While certain avian species are endangered, others are thriving with numbers estimated at 100 million for certain species.  Blackbirds, doves, robins, sparrows, mallards, cardinals, and woodpeckers are among the most common birds in North America. 

                          The Bald Eagle is a bird of prey found in North America.  Its range includes most of Canada, Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and Northern Mexico. Bald eagles are not bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The yellow beak is large and hooked.
                          
                          Foxes have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail.  Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica and the most common species is the red fox.</p>
